As graduation approaches, I look back on my master's years and realize that my life during these two years felt almost sealed away — confined to a small orbit, circling the school and its few surrounding streets. Each day traced the same tiny radius, a routine so fixed that it could almost be drawn as a perfect circle.

Yet if we zoom out, stretch this timeline decades into the future, and then look back, these "confined years" may appear no different from the stories of the students who came before us — the ones from the '80s, the '90s, or even the '50s and '60s. Perhaps one day it will simply be another chapter in a long tradition of people "sailing out" in search of distant horizons. A small coordinate of an era. A detail others will brush over lightly: "Oh, you studied in the U.S. back then?"

But to us, it was dense and heavy with life.

It was every shared meal, every walk across campus together, every silent companionship in libraries and study rooms, every late-night anxiety about the future.

These moments stitched themselves into our youth, thread by thread — small, but weighty, because they were woven by our own hands.

Sometimes I think about how we're reaching the age we used to call "adults," back when we were kids. Yet only we know that somewhere inside, we're still the same children — still kind, still bright, still soft. I wonder how long these simple, unguarded parts of us will remain. Whether the choices ahead, the paths we take, the lives we build, will gradually wear down that innocence.

But for now — at least for this moment — we still carry that unpolished light.

As graduation draws near, we all sense it: the dinners, the meet-ups, the lingering conversations — they may soon become rare, perhaps only a handful of times in the next few years, even the next decade.

Once, we saw each other every day.

We ate together, studied together, wandered into each other's rooms, drank together late into the night.

In a foreign land, we became each other's safety, each other's warmth — a small shared world carved out of loneliness.

And I don't want to call it temporary.

Because those ordinary days, that companionship, has already left an imprint that no one else can replace. Even if we don't meet for a long time, even if our messages slow down, this chapter will not fade. It will surface again in some unexpected moment years later — flowing quietly like a thin river, from youth into middle age, settling softly into the background of our lives.

So I want to write this down.

Not just to remember graduation, but to remind myself of something important:

These encounters, this companionship — they were never just a brief stopover. They were real, vivid, and deeply woven into the fabric of our lives.

We met in a foreign land, and we part in a foreign land —

but someday, in the place we call home, we will meet again.
